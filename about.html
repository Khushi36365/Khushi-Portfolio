            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I‚Äôm Khushi, a passionate Data Science and Artificial Intelligence enthusiast with a strong foundation in Computer Science and a deep curiosity for how data and algorithms can shape human experiences.
                <br><br>
                My journey into AI began with a fascination for how machines could understand and mimic human intelligence ‚Äî from interpreting text and speech to generating new ideas. Since then, I‚Äôve explored various domains including Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI, developing end-to-end solutions that transform data into meaningful insights and intelligent systems.
                <br><br>
                Currently pursuing my Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science and Engineering at BML Munjal University, I combine academic knowledge with hands-on projects and internships that challenge me to design innovative, real-world solutions. Whether it‚Äôs building a speech-to-text AI model, detecting medical conditions from X-rays, or designing an accessible AI chatbot, I thrive on turning ideas into impactful technology.
                <br><br>
                Beyond coding, I enjoy graphic design and creative problem-solving, often using design thinking to make my AI solutions more user-friendly and inclusive.
            </p>

            <h2>üìñ Full Bio</h2>
            <p>
                From my early days as a curious learner exploring how technology can replicate human thinking, to my recent work in AI-driven applications, my journey has been driven by a passion for innovation and learning.
                <br><br>
                During my undergraduate studies at BML Munjal University, I immersed myself in the world of data ‚Äî learning how to clean it, model it, and use it to uncover patterns that can lead to better decision-making. My projects, such as Ragify Audio, a voice-enabled conversational AI system, and Mind Sight, a depression detection model using NLP, have allowed me to explore how AI can be both powerful and empathetic.
                <br><br>
                In my internship at Areksoft Technologies, I gained valuable industry experience working with transformer-based Speech-to-Text models to convert audio into Hindi transcriptions. This project deepened my technical expertise in PyTorch, NLP, and model fine-tuning, while teaching me the importance of model optimization for real-world deployment.
                <br><br>
                I aspire to build a career where I can develop intelligent, human-centered AI systems ‚Äî blending data, design, and innovation to make technology more adaptive, accessible, and impactful.
